# UniFly
Welcome to UniFly on GitHub!
While our code is currently not open source we welcome people to use this space to report bugs and have discussions about our current application.

 * [Why?](#why)

 ### Why?

We wanted a tool that would be easy to connect to and just "work" without the current glitches that other competitor applications currently have by using a central database system and no need to use the out dated Peer to peer sessions.

 ### Installation
 > **Warning**
 > We are currently in beta versions at this current time, and expect to have issues.
